<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
The model we designed is able to predict a total of 419 passengers who survived when the titanic was drown. 
By using 'sci-kit' we are able to design a model which can easily reduce the number of random variables to be considered along with this feature extraction and normalization was also made possible. Through 'sci-kit' automatic grouping of similar objects into sets was also made possible.
Although the model we designed is not predicting the best value, but here is the score and findings.
