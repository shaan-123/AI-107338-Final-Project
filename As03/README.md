<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
The model I designed is able to predict a total of 419 passengers who survived when the titanic was drown. 
By using sci-kit it was easy for me to design a model whiich can easily reduce the number of random variables to be considered along with this feature extraction and normalization was also made possible.
